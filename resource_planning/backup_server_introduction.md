# Backup Server
Veeam Backup & Replication is a modular solution that lets you build a scalable availability infrastructure for environments of different sizes and configurations. The Backup Server is the core component. Features & component requirements will affect your decision how you install the backup server e.g. one datacenter or multiple locations. It could mean that you choose to install additional backup servers or services in remote locations to optimize the data streams.

Before installing the Veeam Backup & Replication server it is important to
understand the different data streams generated by the Veeam Backup Server (VBR) Services.
